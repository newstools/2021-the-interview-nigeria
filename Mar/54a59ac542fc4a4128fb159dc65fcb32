Samia Suluhu Hassan was sworn in today Friday as Tanzania’s first female president after the sudden death of John Magufuli from an illness. The 61-year-old, took the oath of office in Dar es Salaam before inspecting troops at a military parade and receiving a cannon salute. “I, Samia Suluhu Hassan, promise to be honest and obey and protect the constitution of Tanzania,” she said before a room of dignitaries, who applauded when the ceremony was complete. Under the constitution, Hassan will serve the remainder of Magufuli’s second five-year term, which does not expire until 2025. She is the only other current serving female head of state in Africa alongside Ethiopia’s President Sahle-Work Zewde, whose role is mainly ceremonial.
