He, however, stated that “we must not stretch our luck. We must continue with our non-pharmaceutical measures. “We must look at vaccine as a game changer, but make no mistake that it’s a replacement for everything else. ”It is an additional strategy. Vaccines are an addition to the existing response, not a replacement.” (NAN)
