Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy was on Monday found guilty of corruption and sentenced to jail becoming the second head of state in modern-day France to be convicted of corruption after Jacques Chirac. A court in Paris found that Sarkozy had offered to help a magistrate land a prestigious job in return for inside information on an inquiry into his 2012 election campaign finances. Sarkozy, who was President between 2007 to 2012, was sentenced to three years in jail, with two of them suspended. Under the French system he’s unlikely to serve jail time, even if he fails to overturn the verdict on appeal. The court said Sarkozy will be entitled to request to be detained at home with an electronic bracelet. The court said the facts were “particularly serious” given that they were committed by a former president who used his status to help a magistrate who had served his personal interest. As a former lawyer, he was “perfectly informed” about committing an illegal action, the court said. “Sarkozy used his status as former French president,” presiding Judge Christine Mee said. Sarkozy’s two co-defendants (his lawyer and the magistrate) were also found guilty and given the same sentence as Sarkozy. Prosecutors had initially sought a four-year jail term for Sarkozy. Sarkozy will face another trial later this month along with 13 other people on charges of illegal financing of his 2012 presidential campaign.
