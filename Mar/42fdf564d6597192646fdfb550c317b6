You have access to the sea through a cheap means of Transportation, in the cause of the construction of the rail line from Abuja to Maiduguri is about 1000 km.
“The minimum I expect they can employ is between 20,000 and 50,000 workers, if we must achieve it and at the conclusion of construction, imagine how many number of workers will be employed at the industrial park at the seaport. ” The essence of the President’s investment in the project is to create employment, he hopes that we are able to grow the economy of Nigeria through Transportation,  create employment in the cause of these infrastructure. “And at the end of the construction,  we expect those who do businesses in Nigeria to be able to acquire land and site industries along the rail corridor,” Amaechi said.
