Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has promised to bring an end to the traffic gridlock on the Lagos-Apapa Expressway. Sanwolu-Olu, who made this promise via his twitter page on Monday stated that the Apapa traffic menace would soon be history. He disclosed that the state government, together with the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), had taken steps to make it a reality. The governor also noted that a call-up and coding system for trucks making use of the depots had been initiated, and that a joint taskforce had been set up with a primary focus on the Apapa traffic. “Members of the taskforce swung into action over the weekend, dismantling all illegal checkpoints on that route, and blocked all spots being used to extort money from drivers, and ultimately opened up all access roads leading to Apapa.”, he added. He vowed to continue to monitor and enforce new changes and assured that with this new development, citizens who reside and work in that axis will be able to move freely without the fear of traffic congestion or harassment on the roads.
