The president assured them of his firm support as they deliver on their responsibilities. “I have accepted responsibility for your actions in the field; it’s up to you to identify your competent officers irrespective of seniority and paper qualification and deploy them to make sure that we secure this country. “We all look forward to you to perform and I as the Commander-in- Chief, I am backing you hundred per cent, and I expect you to effectively deploy your officers and men to secure the country,” the President said. Responding on behalf of the other service chiefs, the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, assured the president that they would not fail in their responsibilities as the mandate is clear. “Nigeria will have peace again. Based on the mandate, we will address all issues, working with all other security organisations,” he said. Others decorated are Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru as Chief of Army Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo as Chief of Naval Staff and Air Marshal Isiaka Amao as Chief of Air Staff. (NAN)
