Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja on Monday temporary halted the re-trial of former Abia  Governor, Senator Orji Kalu, on alleged corruption charges. Justice Ekwo temporarily stayed the re-trial while delivering ruling in an application by Kalu seeking leave to file a motion against his re-trial for alleged fraud committed when he served as governor of Abia between 1999 and 2007. The ex parte application was filed by Kaluâ€™s counsel, Prof. Awa Kalu, SAN. Justice Ekwo also granted leave to the senator to challenge the legality of the retrial on the same charge.

The Judge also granted Kalu permission to apply for an order of perpetual injunction against the Federal Government through the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, ( EFCC) to prohibit his retrial.

The matter was adjourned until February 23 for mention. Kalu had asked the court to prohibit the EFCC from retrying him on the same alleged N7.1 billion money laundering charge against him. He contented that having been tried once by EFCC, convicted and sentenced in the same charge, FHC/ABJ/CR/56/ 2007, it will amount to double jeopardy for him to be subjected to a fresh trial on the same charge. In his ex-parte motion, Kalu asked that if his application was granted, it should serve as a stay of proceedings until the determination of the application or until the judge otherwise orders. (NAN)
