Police have deployed teams of operatives along the Lekki toll gate and its axis ahead of Saturday’s planned EndSARS protest at the toll gate. The Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of the Lagos State Police Command confirmed the deployment. The Lagos Police department said this was “part of efforts to stop crime as well as boost the morale of the police officers in the areas”. However, two opposing camps – #OccupyLekkiTollGate and #DefendLagos – have said that they would have two separate protests on Saturday. The call for Saturday’s protest was initiated after the nine-member of the Lagos Panel of Inquiry approved the reopening of the toll gate. The chairman, Justice Doris Okuwobi and four others ruled in favour of another application by the Lekki Concession Company (LCC).
