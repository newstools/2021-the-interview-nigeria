He said that pensioners who were yet to submit their documents for consideration should do so now. “They can submit their documents at PTAD Headquarters in Abuja, PTAD State Offices or scan the documents and send via email,” he said. He urged the pensioners to also bear in mind that the country is still dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for adequate safety protocols. Ajayi said that the exercise was strictly based on appointments only, following submission of documents, pensioners would be invited on a given date and time. (NAN)
