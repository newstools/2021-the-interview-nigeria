The Lagos state judicial panel on restitution for victims of SARS related abuses and other matters has summoned Mohammed Adamu, Inspector-General of police (IGP) this afternoon. The Justice Doris Okuwobi-led panel summoned the Police boss on Tuesday following a petition by one Adewale Adewuyi, who is on a stretcher. The petitioner’s lawyer, Debo Adeleke, told the panel that the police had refused to release 26 acres of farmland seized from the petitioner since 2013. “The police seized the petitioner’s farmland since 2013, without any need for it or (erecting) a structure on it. “The case had gone up for CMC, where parties resolved that the Police should release the said farmland,” Mr. Adewale said. The Citizens Mediation Centre (CMC) is an alternative dispute resolution mechanism of the Lagos State Ministry of Justice. Adeleke asked the panel to summon the IGP so that the police could be compelled to release the seized farmland. Justice Doris Okuwobi granted the request and ordered the petitioner, to serve the IGP, AIG Co-operative, COP Legal Department and Surveyor-General of Lagos State within seven days to state their own side of the story. The matter was adjourned to March 30, 2021.
