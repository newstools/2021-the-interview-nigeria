We have identified some routes which will be designated for the buses.” Ganduje said that the government is trying to introduce the mass transit system in addition to a light rail project, for which it has signed an agreement with a private company for the construction. “We have appealed to the Federal Government and a Chinese bank and they have approved a loan for the light rail project,” he said. The governor also said that foundation stone for the light rail project would be laid before the end of 2021. “It will take a long process and the incoming governor will continue from where we stopped,: he said.
