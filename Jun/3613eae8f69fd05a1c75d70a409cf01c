According to her, it is so sad that in Nigeria, women have poor record of participation in politics. “Would you ever have thought that Nigeria would be like that with all the educated women? “We have the vocal women and you know all the women that have paved way before like Mrs. Ransome kuti and at this age we are still at this level. “I think what we should do is to keep mounting pressure so that they would legislate for a certain percentage of seats to be reserved for women. “This is because we cannot compete equally with the men and we all know this has a lot to do with financial strength and the women are not strong financially. “It will be a great help if the legislators at the federal and state levels agree to reserve certain number of seats for women,’’ El-Rufai said. She commended the former chairperson and members of the forum for the peaceful conduct of the election and solicited the support of the media in promoting activities of the forum. (NAN)
