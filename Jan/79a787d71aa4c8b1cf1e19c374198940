The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun has expressed sadness over the death of a former Minister of Commerce and Industries, Senator Jubril Martins-Kuye. This is contained in a statement issued by Tunde Oladunjoye, Publicity Secretary, Ogun APC Caretaker Committee in Abeokuta on Sunday. Martins-Kuye died in his residence in Lagos on Sunday at the age of 78. The ruling party spokesman described Martins-Kuye’s death as “the passing away of one of Ogun’s finest politicians’’. “He was an uncommon bridge builder, patriot and a humane, courteous and humble politician whose model was politics without bitterness. “Either as a Federal minister or as a Senator of the Federal Republic, Martins-Kuye gave a good account of himself as an accessible community leader, grassroots mobiliser, moulder of people and builder of bridges,’’ he said. He commiserated with Governor Dapo Abiodun and the people of Ogun on the exit of the ‘political titan’. “We pray that God will grant the deceased immediate and political family, the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.’’ Martins-Kuye was born on August 16, 1942, in Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State. He was a Senator in the Third Republic and the Peoples’ Democratic Party governorship candidate in Ogun in 1999. Martins-Kuye was appointed Minister of State for Finance in June 1999 during the first term of President Olusegun Obasanjo. On April 6, 2010, Martins-Kuye was also appointed Minister of Commerce and Industry by the then Acting President Goodluck Jonathan. (NAN)
