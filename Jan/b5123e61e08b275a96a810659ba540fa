Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has asked Lagosians to take the COVID-19 pandemic more seriously so as to avoid another lockdown in the state. The governor in a message on his Facebook page on Tuesday said there was an urgent need for everyone in the state to be more circumspect in the way theylive, interact and socialize with friends and family. Many people, he said were ignoring #COVID-19 warnings and guidelines, thereby exposing themselves and others to the virus. He said, “We are well into the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Yesterday, Lagos scarily recorded its highest number of infection in one day (712). “We have already recorded a frightening spike in infection cases. This spike brings positive cases to a total of 32,720 in Lagos alone.” READ ALSO: Lagos, Kaduna, FCT Account For 70% Of COVID-19 Infections The governor said, “This second wave comes with severe symptoms, and the higher number of positive cases we detect, the higher number of casualties we’re bound to record. “We do not want this, but for this to be avoided, we must be intentional and cautious.” “We also do not want to go into another lockdown. It is important that you wear your masks, avoid crowded areas, wash or sanitize your hands regularly, and practice social distancing,” Sanwo-Olu said. 2021, he added, “will only work for us if we take #COVID19 seriously and follow the guidelines laid down by LSMOH. We simply cannot afford to be complacent at this time.”
