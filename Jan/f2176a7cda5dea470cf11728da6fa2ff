President Muhammadu Buhari has arrived in Daura, Katsina State, his hometown, for a four-day official visit. Garba Shehu, the President’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, confirmed this development in a statement in Abuja on Friday. Shehu said the president was welcomed on arrival at the Umaru Musa Yar’Adua International Airport, Katsina, by Governor Aminu Masari, the Deputy Governor, the Speaker of the State House of Assembly and the Chief Judge. In Daura, the Emir, Alhaji Faruk Umar Faruk, led District Heads and traditional title holders to receive the president at the Helipad. In the course of his stay in Daura, President Buhari is expected to, among other engagements, participate in the All Progressives Party (APC) membership registration and revalidation exercise. According to Shehu, the president considers this exercise as a very important one for the nation’s democracy and its yearning for good leadership as a requirement of the process of nation building. In a broadcast last week, Buhari urged “all good people,” not only to speak but to rise up and “get involved in the task of improving their society.” He added that “for most citizens, their greatest weapon is their vote. Register now for your Party and register when the time comes for elections.” The President is expected to return to the nation’s capital, Abuja, on Tuesday.
