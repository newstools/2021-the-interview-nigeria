The Federal Government has said the  January 18 date set for the resumption of schools is not sacrosanct and is subject to review. The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, said on Monday during the press briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, that they’re aware of the rising COVID-19 figures and must put that into consideration in reviewing the resumption date for schools. He said about January 18 date, “It is not sacrosanct. When we decided on that date it was just a target towards what we were working on. Of course, we are keeping it in view and looking at what is happening in society and then it is supposed to be subject to constant review. “Even today at the PTF meeting, we looked at the rising figures and thought about if we should probably take another look at it. On the January 18 resumption, we are reviewing it, we are going to review it. He said, “At the PTF meeting today, we considered it and tomorrow the Ministry is going to take it up.”
