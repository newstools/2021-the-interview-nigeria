The Academic Staff Union of the Universities (ASUU) had in March 2020, embarked on an indefinite strike nationwide. The lecturers were agitating for adequate funding of the university system, which was part of agreement reached with the  Federal Government in 2009. They were also calling for the adoption of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) in the place of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS), among others. The Federal Government had insisted it would only pay lecturers’ allowances with IPPIS but ASUU said it would only agree to UTAS, its home-grown system. After several meetings and agreements reached between ASUU and the Federal Government, the union suspended its nine-month strike on December 23, 2020. (NAN)
