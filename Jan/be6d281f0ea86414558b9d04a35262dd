Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission has said it has not increased electricity tariff by 50 per cent. In a statement on Tuesday denying media reports on the increase, NERC said, instead that tariffs remain frozen for consumers receiving less the 12 hours of electricity each day. The statement read, “The Commission hereby state unequivocally that NO approval has been granted for a 50% tariff increase in the Tariff Order for electricity distribution companies which took effect on January 1, 2021. “On the contrary, the tariff for customers on service bands D & E (customers being served less than an average of 12hrs of supply per day over a period of one month) remains frozenand subsidised in line with the policy direction of the Federal Government.” The Commission said, “In compliance with the provisions of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act (EPRSA) and the nation’s tariff methodology for biannual minor review, the rates for service bands A, B, C, D and E have been adjusted by NGN2.00 to NGN4.00 per kWhr to reflect the partial impact of inflation and movement in foreign exchange rates. “In the light of strong public interest on this matter, the media is hereby requested to retract their earlier publications misinforming electricity consumers nationwide about a purported 50% increase in electricity tariffs.” The Commission said it remained committed to protecting electricity consumers from failure to deliver on committed service levels under the service-based tariff regime.
