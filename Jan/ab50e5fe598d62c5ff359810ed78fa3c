Veteran Yoruba actress, Folake Aremu, popularly known as Orishabunmi is dead. Orishabunmi died late Tuesday night after a brief illness at the age of 60, just four months after the death of her ex-husband, Jimoh Aliu. She became popular in the 80s TV series Arelu starring her husband and others like Fadeyi Oloro. Mr. Bolaji Amusan, the National President of the Theatre Arts and Motion Pictures Practitioners Association of Nigeria (TAMPAN), who confirmed the death in a statement on Wednesday, said Orishabunmi’s demise was a big loss to the entertainment industry and Nollywood in particular. “O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting. It is so sad we lost a priceless jewel, a very rare gem in the Nigerian film industry, Chief Mrs Folakemi Aremu aka Orishabunm to the cold hands of death last night. “Though good people die everyday yet not all of them affirm for us the goodness in humanity the way Orishabunmi did. She passed away leaving a legacy of positive experiences for anyone who took the time to know her. “If Oratory is the masterful art, the world will surely miss Orishabunmi for her talent,” he said. TAMPAN member, Tunde Ola-Yusuff, also made a confirmation of the death in a Facebook post. He said, “She left without a goodbye. The sudden death of Mrs Folake Aremu (ORISABUNMI) has been announced. “Really a shock on everyone. Iya Oosa, may God rest your Soul among the righteous.” Amusan added that Orishabunmi was an orator who would perfectly chant eloquently with her resounding sonorous voice, adding that the industry would surely miss her. He said that the burial arrangement would be communicated soon.
