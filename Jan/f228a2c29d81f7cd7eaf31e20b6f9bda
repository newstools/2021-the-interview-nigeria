The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has opposed a bail application filed by the former Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, who is on trial for money laundering and diverting billions of naira in pension funds. The EFCC on Wednesday told a Federal High Court that the he plans to once again jump bail and flee to the United States of America. The Commission filed an objection in a document recounting Maina’s previous attempt to obtain travel papers in Niger Republic, from where he was extradited back to Nigeria.

EFCC said, “After jumping court bail, Maina sneaked to the Niger Republic to obtain new travel documents at the US Embassy in Niamey to enable him flee back to the US where he and his family are equally citizens.” The Commission also dismissed Maina’s claim of deteriorating health, for which he is seeking to be granted fresh bail by the court.
