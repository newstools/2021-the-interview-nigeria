The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on Wednesday said it intercepted 4,995,200 capsules of tramadol weighing 2,498.2kilogrammes at the Onne port, Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Mr. Femi Babafemi, director, Media and Advocacy of the Agency, said this in a statement in Abuja. He said efforts by the NDLEA to block access and availability of illicit substances had led to the interception of the container conveying the illicit drugs. Babafemi said the seizure of the illicit drug concealed in 1,387 cartons on Tuesday, May 18 followed a joint examination by NDLEA operatives and Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) personnel. He explained the drugs were concealed in a container marked MRKU 0764717, which had since been on the agencyâ€™s watch list. In another development, Babafemi said a 42-year-old man, Muntari Hamidu, had been arrested in Nyibango, Jimeta, Yola, Adamawa state with 13 sacks of cannabis sativa weighing 166kg. Babafemi also said a 35-year-old man, Sani Musa, was also nabbed with 16.1kg of skunk at Ngurore, Yola South LGA of the state, noting that both suspects were arrested on May 16. He said a team of NDLEA operatives from Ondo State Command also arrested one James Godspower with 36.5kg of cannabis sativa in Faloye, Ogbese, Akure North LGA of Ondo State. He quoted the Chairman, NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (Rtd.) as lauding the renewed synergy between the agency and other security agencies in its operations. Marwa commended the officers and men of the Port Harcourt, Port Command, as well as those of Adamawa and Ondo State Commands for their resilience and commitment to work. He charged the officers and men of the agency to remain vigilant in the course of their assignment. (NAN)
