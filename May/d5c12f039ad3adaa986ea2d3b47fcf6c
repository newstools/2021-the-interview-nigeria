President Muhammadu Buhari has celebrated the Children’s Day with a solemn promise to bequeath a better country for the present and future generations. Malam Garba Shehu, the President’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, quoted the president as making the promise when he hosted a group of children at the forecourt of the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Thursday. As part of the activities to commemorate Children’s Day, observed on May 27, the Nigerian leader posed for group photograph with the children. The short ceremony also witnessed the cutting of a ‘national cake’, a guided tour of the President’s office, meeting rooms, banquet hall and the zoo at the Presidential Villa.
