The managing director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Bala Usman, has been suspended. Reports on Thursday said that the president had also immediately appointed NPAâ€™s director of finance, Mohammed Koko, to replace Usman in acting capacity. President Buhari first appointed Usman in 2016 and reappointed her for a second tenure in January 2021, after the NPA board was reconstituted. However, no reasons have been given for the suspension of the self-acclaimed ports reformist. A founding member of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Usman is one of the conveners of the Bring Back Our Girls Campaign (BBOG). She was also the Chief of Staff to the Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State from 2015 to 2016.
