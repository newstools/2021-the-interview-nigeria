The Kaduna State Government led by Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai has declared the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) National President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, wanted over the five-day strike in Kaduna State. El-Rufai who had earlier described the five-day warning strike as a campaign against the state’s economy and social sabotage promised to reward anyone with information on Ayuba’s whereabouts. He wrote, on his official Twitter page @elrufai, “KADUNA UPDATE: Ayuba Wabba & others of @NLCHeadquarters declared wanted for economic sabotage & attacks on public infrastructure under Miscellaneous Offences Act. “Anyone that knows where he is hiding should send a message to @MOJKaduna. KDSG. There will be a handsome reward!” The Organised labour in Kaduna State had on Monday proceeded on a five-day warning strike in protest against the Governor el-Rufai’s decisions and policies on issues concerning civil servants in the state. They accused the state government of failing to pay the retirement benefits of 80 per cent of the 35, 000 civil servants it disengaged in 2017. They also disclosed that the government which they had commended as being one of the first to pay the new N30,000 minimum wage reverted to old minimum wage of N18, 000 in the month of April.
